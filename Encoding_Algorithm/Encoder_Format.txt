https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_representation_(computer_chess)

A full description of a chess position, i.e. the position "state", must contain the following elements:

-The location of each piece on the board
-Whose turn it is to move
-Status of the 50-move draw rule. The name of this is sometimes a bit confusing, as it is 50 moves by each player, and therefore 100 half-moves, or ply. For example, if the previous 80 half-moves passed without a capture or a pawn move, the fifty-move rule will kick in after another twenty half-moves.
-Whether either player is permanently disqualified to castle, both kingside and queenside.
-If an en passant capture is possible.

LOCATION (32 BYTES)

Using a Hexadecimal Character to represent each unit on a chessboard.

0 = Empty Square 

1 = White King = W.King ♔
2 = White Queen = W.Queen
3 = White Rook = W.Rook
4 = White Bishop = W.Bishop
5 = White Knight = W.Knight
6 = White Pawn = W.Pawn

D = Empty Row = 00000000
E = Empty 4 squares = 0000
Precedence given to D then E then F
F = nmF Next n squares are m. (only useful when number of spaces >= 3)
Fg : 87F Next 8 squares are 7 (Black Pawn)


7 = Black Pawn = B.Pawn
8 = Black Knight = B.Knight
9 = Black Bishop = B.Bishop
A = Black Rook = B.Rook
B = Black Queen = B.Queen
C = Black King = B.King ♚

MOVE TURN AND CASTLING RIGHTS AND ENPASSANT ALLOWED WITH POSITION (1.5 BYTE)

0000 0000 0000 - Convert to Hexadecimal

1 - 0/1 Black/White Turn to play 

2 - Black Kingside castle - 0/1
3 - Black Queenside castle - 0/1
4 - White Kingside castle - 0/1
5 - White Queenside castle - 0/1

6 - 0/1 En passant allowed if possible

Following is only considered when 6th bit of previous information is 1 (Enpassant allowed)

7 - 0/1 = Enpassant row for hexadecimal
8 - 0/1 = Enpassant row for hexadecimal
9 - 0/1 = Enpassant row for hexadecimal
Rows 1 - 8

10 - 0/1 = Enpassant coloumn for hexadecimal
11 - 0/1 = Enpassant coloumn for hexadecimal
12 - 0/1 = Enpassant coloumn for hexadecimal
Columns a - h

Enpassant Row and Coloumn will only hold information 

Eg :
1111 1000 0000  = F80 
For starting position (White to play, no enpassant, all castling allowed)

50 MOVE DRAW (1 BYTE)

Total = 32 + 1.5 + 1 = 34.5 Bytes (Worst Case Scenario)

Total = LOCATION + MOVE TURN/ CASTLING RIGHT/ ENPASSANT ALLOWED - ENPASSANT INFO + 50 MOVE DRAW
